## *Introduction to Deployment pipelines*

A deployment pipeline is a structured process used to deliver software from development to production. Its stages typically include:

1. **Code Development**: Writing and committing code to a version control system.
2. **Build**: Compiling code and creating executable artifacts.
3. **Testing**: Running automated tests (unit, integration, etc.) to ensure quality.
4. **Staging**: Deploying to a pre-production environment for final validation.
5. **Deployment**: Releasing the software to the production environment.

Different deployment strategies include:
- **Canary Deployment**: Gradually rolling out changes to a small subset of users.
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Using two identical environments, switching traffic when ready.
- **Rolling Deployment**: Updating instances incrementally with no downtime.
